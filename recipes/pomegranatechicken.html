    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The gorgeous glaze on this chicken is made with pomegranate juice that's reduced until syrupy. 
        Pomegranates are actually named in the Torah and are used in Jewish dishes throughout the year. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups pomegranate juice </li>
        <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice </li>
        <li>1 lime </li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken </li>
        <li>½ small onion </li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons salt, divided </li>
        <li>1 bay leaf </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir pomegranate juice, brown sugar, vinegar, and garlic together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and discard garlic, then stir in lime juice and let cool 5 minutes. Set aside 6 tablespoons pomegranate syrup.</li>
        <li>Poke several holes in lime with a fork and insert into chicken cavity along with onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt, bay leaf, pepper, and rosemary. Tie legs together with kitchen string, sprinkle skin with remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, then transfer chicken, breast side up, to a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast chicken, basting with pomegranate syrup every 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest parts of all pieces registers 165 degrees F, about 1 hour total. Let chicken rest 10 minutes before carving. Serve drizzled with reserved pomegranate syrup.</li>
