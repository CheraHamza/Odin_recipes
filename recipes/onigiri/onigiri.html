    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Before heading into work in Tokyo, I often stopped at a little stand where an elderly woman sold nothing but rice balls.<br> Onigiri is a quintessential Japanese food: made by moms for breakfast, lunch boxes, and picnics.<br> It is the ideal handheld food (the nori wrapper keeps the sticky rice from getting all over your hand).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li><br>
        <li>1 cup warm cooked rice</li><br>
        <li>4 teaspoons cooked flaked fresh salmon or flaked canned salmon</li><br>
        <li>2 sheets yakinori, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, dissolve the salt in 1 cup water. Dip your hands into the salted water, then grab 1/4 cup of the rice.<br> Using your hands, shape the rice into a small, fat triangle, then use your thumb to create an indentation in the center.<br> Place a teaspoonful of the salmon in the hollow, dampen your hands lightly again,<br> and pat the rice over the hollow to encase the salmon. Repeat to create 3 more rice balls.</li> <br>
