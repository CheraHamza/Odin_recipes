    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth,<br>
        often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma, and scallions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)* </li><br>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season </li><br>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter </li><br>
        <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil </li><br>
        <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced </li><br>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced </li><br>
        <li>3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce </li><br>
        <li>2 Tbsp mirin </li><br>
        <li>4 cups rich chicken stock </li><br>
        <li>1 oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh) </li><br>
        <li>1–2 tsp sea salt, to taste </li><br>
        <li>2 large eggs </li><br>
        <li>1/2 cup scallions, sliced </li><br>
        <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles </li><br>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Cook the chicken: Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li><br>

        <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, <br>and cook
            until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes.<br> Flip the chicken over
            and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li><br>

        <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.<br> Remove
            from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li><br>

        <li>Make the ramen broth: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, until shimmering. <br>Add the garlic and
            ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin,<br> and stir to combine. Cook
            for another minute.</li><br>

        <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes,<br> then add
            the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.</li><br>

        <li>Make the soft-boiled eggs: Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil.<br> Gently lower
            the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water,<br> and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a
            slightly-runny yoke) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yoke).</li><br>

        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, <br>transfer the eggs to the ice bath to
            stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, <br>or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away
            the shell and slice in half, <br>lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.</li><br>

        <li>Assemble the ramen bowls: Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). <br>Slice the chicken into thin
            pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
        </li><br>

        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls.<br> Add the sliced chicken and
            the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.</li><br>
    </ol>
